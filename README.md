This repository contains my personal collection of React.js projects created while learning and exploring the React library.
Each project focuses on understanding a specific React concept — from components and props to hooks, state management, and API integration.

#Tech Stack

1.React.js (with Vite / CRA).
2.JavaScript (ES6+).
3.Tailwind CSS / CSS3 for styling.
4.React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, etc.).
5.Git & GitHub for version control.

#Learning Goals

1.Build practical understanding of React fundamentals.
2.Get hands-on experience with hooks and components.
3.Practice debugging and clean code structure.
4.Prepare for advanced React topics like Context API, Redux, and performance optimization.
