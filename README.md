This repository contains my personal collection of React.js projects created while learning and exploring the React library.
Each project focuses on understanding a specific React concept — from components and props to hooks, state management, and API integration.

#Tech Stack

React.js (with Vite / CRA)
JavaScript (ES6+)
Tailwind CSS / CSS3 for styling
React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, etc.)
Git & GitHub for version control

#Learning Goals

Build practical understanding of React fundamentals.
Get hands-on experience with hooks and components.
Practice debugging and clean code structure.
Prepare for advanced React topics like Context API, Redux, and performance optimization.
